            <h3>Mugisha J Ministries Mentoring youth</h3>            
            <p>Young people everywhere are working a hard to effect positive changes in the world; 
                Academically gifted but financially unlucky are no exception. The Mugisha J Ministries 
                is recognizing such young people and is providing school fees to them at all levels of 
                education in order to make their dreams come true. Among the young people being sponsored 
                are orphans and academically disciplined children we would be grateful through your donations 
                to increase the number while lifting the name of Christ high. The Ministry has also given out 
                capital to one Sanyu Florence to startup a hand craft workshop shoe making which turned out to 
                be are only source of income as per now Sanyu is now teaching other congregants how to make shoes 
                in order to earn</p>
